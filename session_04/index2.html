        What if our garment could recognize and respond to the gaze of the other?<br>
        Caress of the Gaze is an interactive 3D-printed wearable which can detect <br>
        other peopleâ€™s gaze and respond accordingly with life-like behavior.<br>
        Our skin is constantly in motion. It expands, contracts and changes its shape
     <br>
        based on various internal and external stimuli including not only temperature <br> 
        and moisture but also feelings such as fear, excitement and anger.<br></p>
